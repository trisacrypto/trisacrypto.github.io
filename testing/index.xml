These services are as follows:
Alice (api.alice.vaspbot.net:443): the primary integration rVASP used to trigger and receive TRISA messages. Bob (api.bob.vaspbot.net:443): a demo rVASP to view exchanges with Alice. Evil (api.evil.vaspbot.net:443): an &amp;ldquo;evil&amp;rdquo; rVASP that is not a TRISA TestNet member, used to test non-authenticated interactions. Note: the rVASPs are currently primarily configured for demos.</description></item><item><title>TRISA CLI</title><link>https://trisa.dev/testing/trisa-cli/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Apr 2022 12:09:09 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://trisa.dev/testing/trisa-cli/</guid><description>The TRISA command line client is a utility that assists TRISA integrators and developers testing their TRISA service. Advanced users may also use the TRISA client to execute TRISA requests for compliance purposes, although this is not recommended for extensive use. To install the latest version of the TRISA CLI, you must have Go installed on your computer. The following command will install the latest version of the CLI:
$ go install github.</description></item><item><title>Creating Test Certificates</title><link>https://trisa.dev/testing/certs-cli/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jun 2022 15:45:48 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://trisa.dev/testing/certs-cli/</guid><description>In the process of testing your TRISA implementation, you may wish to generate some test certificates (e.g. for use in unit testing). The TRISA engineers have created a command line tool for this purpose, which can be found in the trisacrypto/directory repository.
The Certificates command line client is a utility designed for local disk certificate management and test Certificate Authority (CA) for testing purposes. The code is located under cmd/certs. To install the latest version of the Certificates CLI, you must have Go installed on your computer.</description></item></channel></rss>
