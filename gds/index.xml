This service includes four types of RPCs:
RPCs designed to support interactions with the Global Directory Service during a TRISA information transfer: Lookup and Search (Note: These are the primary Directory Service interactions.) RPCs designed to support the Directory Service registration and verification processes: Register and VerifyContact RPCs designed to supply the entity review and TRISA verification status of a given VASP: Verification RPCs designed to enable routine health check and status requests: Status (Note: these mirror the TRISAHealth service) service TRISADirectory { rpc Lookup(LookupRequest) returns (LookupReply) {} rpc Search(SearchRequest) returns (SearchReply) {} rpc Register(RegisterRequest) returns (RegisterReply) {} rpc VerifyContact(VerifyContactRequest) returns (VerifyContactReply) {} rpc Verification(VerificationRequest) returns (VerificationReply) {} rpc Status(HealthCheck) returns (ServiceState) {}}Lookup The Lookup RPC is designed to provide VASP certification information.</description></item><item><title>Accessing Members</title><link>https://trisa.dev/gds/members/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jan 2022 14:02:37 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://trisa.dev/gds/members/</guid><description>The TRISAMembers service is an experimental service that provides extra, secure access to the directory service for verified TRISA members. Only members of the TRISA network (e.g. members who have been issued valid identity certificates) can access detailed directory service data about the network using this service. Note: Once validated, this service will be moved into the official TRISA specification.
