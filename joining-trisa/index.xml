Emailed PKCS12 Encrypted Certificates Certificate Signing Request (CSR) You must select one of these options when you submit your registration; after your registration is submitted you will not be able to switch between options.
PKCS12 Encrypted Email Attachment The first mechanism is the easiest â€” simply select the email option during registration and omit the CSR fields.</description></item><item><title>TRIXO Form</title><link>https://trisa.dev/joining-trisa/trixo/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jun 2022 09:15:46 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://trisa.dev/joining-trisa/trixo/</guid><description>The purpose of the TRIXO questionnaire is to provide responses to a common set of questions VASPs might ask each other before exchanging Travel Rule information.
When registering for TRISA membership, applicants must submit their TRIXO questionnaire in JSON form (shown below) as part of their application. After a VASP has been issued certificates, these TRIXO details are logged in the TRISA Global Directory Service to facilitate member lookups and mutual verification ahead of information exchanges.</description></item><item><title>Anatomy of a PKCS12 file</title><link>https://trisa.dev/joining-trisa/pkcs12/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jun 2022 09:15:46 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://trisa.dev/joining-trisa/pkcs12/</guid><description>When your registration has been reviewed and approved, you will receive mTLS certificates from the Global Directory Service (GDS). These will be sent via an email containing PKCS12 password protected certificates.
What to expect after registration and during certificate issuance:
If the registration form is valid: GDS will return a PKCS12 password. This is the password you will use to decrypt your certificates. NoteThis is the only time the PKCS12 password is made available during the certificate issuance process.</description></item><item><title>Sectigo</title><link>https://trisa.dev/joining-trisa/sectigo/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Dec 2020 07:58:37 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://trisa.dev/joining-trisa/sectigo/</guid><description>The TRISA Directory Service issues certificates using the Sectigo Certificate Authority via its IoT Portal. Because the directory service must collect public key material in order to facilitate an initial trusted handshake for mTLS, it uses the Sectigo IoT Manager API as part of the VASP registration and verification process. The github.com/trisacrypto/directory/pkg/sectigo package is a Go library for interacting with the API, implementing the endpoints and methods required by the directory service.</description></item></channel></rss>
