All TRISA members must implement both services described by the TRISA protocol (the TRISANetwork service and the TRISAHealth service) to ensure that exchanges are conducted correctly and securely.
The protocol buffers can be compiled into the language of your choice. This section describes the protocol buffers for the TRISANetwork endpoint and the protocol buffer API in Go.</description></item></channel></rss>
