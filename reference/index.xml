The unsealing keys for these envelopes should be stored separately, and should be deleted once the compliance period has ended, rendering the Envelopes un-openable. This is commonly referred to as &amp;ldquo;deletion by erasure&amp;rdquo;. Note that compliance periods differ by region and jurisdiction but are typically between 5 and 7 years.</description></item><item><title>FAQ</title><link>https://trisa.dev/reference/faq/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jun 2021 15:59:09 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://trisa.dev/reference/faq/</guid><description>What does the &amp;ldquo;TRISA&amp;rdquo; acronym mean? TRISA stands for Travel Rule Information Sharing Architecture.
What is TRISA? TRISA is a peer-to-peer network that enables compliance with the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) Travel Rule for transaction identity information.
TRISA is also a protocol that enables the secure exchange of PII between members.
