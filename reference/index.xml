TRISA stands for Travel Rule Information Sharing Architecture.
What is TRISA? TRISA is a peer-to-peer network that enables compliance with the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) Travel Rule for transaction identity information.
TRISA is also a protocol that enables the secure exchange of PII between members.

The unsealing keys for these envelopes should be stored separately, and should be deleted once the compliance period has ended, rendering the Envelopes un-openable. This is commonly referred to as &amp;ldquo;deletion by erasure&amp;rdquo;. Note that compliance periods differ by region and jurisdiction but are typically between 5 and 7 years.</description></item></channel></rss>
